**`Nvis`** is a visualization tool designed for exploring temporal interval hierarchies generated by the **`nfer`** tool. **`Nfer`** is a language and framework for event stream abstraction with several capabilities, one of which is deriving temporal intervals that satisfy certain temporal properties from event traces. These properties can be defined as *rules* in **`nfer`** which can either be mined automatically or be defined manaully. You can access **`nfer`** in [this repository](https://bitbucket.org/seanmk/nfer/src/master/), and read more about this formalism in the two following papers:

> Sean Kauffman, Klaus Havelund, Rajeev Joshi, and Sebastian Fischmeister. Inferring event stream abstractions. Formal Methods in System Design, pages 54 - 82. Springer, Aug 1, 2018.


**`Nvis`** implements an algorithm that solves the two main challenges with visualizing temporal intervals: hierarchy and concurrency. Hierarchical sturctures are generated by nested rules, i.e., rules that contain other rules in a hierarchical way. Concurrency, on the other hand, is introduced where several overlapping intervals of the same type (the same identifier but with different data maps) occur in a trace.

<!-- Is installation the good word here? -->
## Installation

<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">
<span style="all: unset;">

The tool is tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu distribution) operating systems. Use at your own risk for other operating systems. In addition, creating a virtual environment is not necessary but is recommended to keep the dependencies consistent and avoid conflicts. To install the tool:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```
<!-- For windows and linux, python 3 only (python vs python3 commands?). Also, mention what platforms it is tested on -->
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

<div style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px">
<span style="all: unset;">

<!-- Explain that the app has a web interface that sends data via json from python backend to the front-end, ports and making sure the port is free, how to give the files, what files are needed and in what format, etc -->

Provide example commands or scripts to run the project.
```bash
python main.py
```
